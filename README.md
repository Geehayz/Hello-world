# Hello-world

My first repository - Self description.

Thank you for reading my README. My name is Greg and I'm originally from Salt Lake City, Utah but have lived half my life in Seattle, Washington as well. I currently reside in Millcreek, Utah. Until recently I have been working with special ed. students for Murray School District at Horizon Elementary. Now I'm a Lyft driver and I go to school at Salt Lake Community College. I have a pit bull named Toby and a cat named Bagheera. My favorite past time is playing video games and my favorite food is sushi. Thanks again!
